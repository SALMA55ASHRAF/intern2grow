thats my project with intern2grow as first project as data analysis istart by seeing and exploring data this data have 6 features which are :
1)product
2) revenue
3)quantity
4)price
5)date
6)catogry
then i start to fix data first i fix date column  ihave make it all in same format 
then see if theres anull or missing value i figure out there was null values in price , revenue, quantity which was easy to collect as revenue = price * quantity so if you have any two of them you can calculate other
then i start search for duplicates and drop them it was only one row and i drop it 
then our data was clean 
i start doing some statistical tests using describe function which show me max ,min,Q1,Q2,Q3 which were very important 
then is start to answer some questions those questions was :
1-What was the total revenue generated by the company over the course of the year?
2-Which product had the highest revenue? How much revenue did it generate?
3-What was the average price of a product sold by the company?
